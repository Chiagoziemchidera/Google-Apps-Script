# Automated Invoice Generation and Emailing Using Google Apps Script

Overview
This project involves creating a Google Apps Script that automates the generation of invoices from a Google Sheets template. The script pulls data from two Google Sheets, fills in an invoice template with the appropriate details, converts the filled template into a PDF, and automatically emails the invoice to the respective client. This automation simplifies the invoicing process, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and consistency across all generated invoices.

Project Objectives
Automate Invoice Generation: Automatically generate invoices based on data stored in Google Sheets.
Template-Based Invoice Creation: Use a predefined Google Sheets template for consistent invoice formatting.
PDF Conversion: Convert the filled invoice template into a PDF format, suitable for emailing.
Automated Email Sending: Automatically send the generated invoice PDF to the client's email address.

Key Features
Google Sheets Integration:
Invoice Data Sheet: Contains essential invoice details such as client name, email address, invoice number, invoice date, total amount, and due date.
Item Data Sheet: Contains detailed item information associated with each invoice, including item descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and total prices.
Invoice Template: A predefined Google Sheets template with placeholders that are filled with data from the other sheets.

Data Extraction:
The script retrieves data from the Invoice Data Sheet and Item Data Sheet to populate the invoice template.

Template Population:
Placeholders in the invoice template are dynamically replaced with actual data (e.g., client name, invoice number, item details).

PDF Generation:
The filled template is converted into a PDF format for each invoice.

Email Automation:
The script automatically sends the generated PDF invoice to the client's email address with a custom message.

Logging and Debugging:
The script includes logging to track the status of each generated and sent invoice, aiding in debugging and process monitoring.

Technical Details
Programming Language: JavaScript (Google Apps Script)
Google Services Used:
Google Sheets: For data storage and template management.
Google Drive: For storing the generated PDF files temporarily.
Gmail: For sending out the invoices via email.

Script Logic:
Access the necessary sheets from the active Google Spreadsheet.
Retrieve all relevant data from the Invoice Data Sheet and Item Data Sheet.
Loop through each row in the Invoice Data Sheet to generate individual invoices.
For each invoice:
Clear any previous data in the invoice template.
Populate the template with data from the current invoice.
Fill in item details corresponding to the invoice number.
Copy the filled template to a new temporary spreadsheet.
Convert the temporary spreadsheet to a PDF.
Send the PDF via email to the client.
Log the action for tracking and debugging.
Delete the temporary spreadsheet to keep the Google Drive clean.
Include a brief pause between email sends to prevent hitting Google’s rate limits.

Use Cases
Small to Medium-Sized Businesses: Automating the invoicing process to save time and reduce manual errors.
Freelancers and Consultants: Streamlining the generation and sending of invoices to clients after completing projects or services.
Educational Institutions: Generating and distributing invoices for tuition fees, course materials, or other services.

Benefits
Efficiency: Eliminates the need for manual invoice creation and emailing, saving significant time.
Consistency: Ensures that all invoices follow a consistent format, reducing the chance of errors.
Scalability: The script can handle multiple invoices in a single run, making it suitable for businesses with a large client base.
Cost-Effective: Utilizes Google’s free tools (Sheets, Drive, Gmail) without the need for expensive software.

Potential Enhancements
Customization: The script can be expanded to include customizable email templates, additional invoice data fields, or integration with payment gateways.
Dashboard: Create a Google Sheets dashboard to monitor invoice status (sent, pending, paid).
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling to manage issues like missing data or email failures.
This project showcases the power of Google Apps Script in automating routine business tasks, offering a seamless and efficient solution for managing invoicing processes.
