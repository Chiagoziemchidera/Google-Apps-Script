# Newsletter-Automation
This project aims to automate the process of sending personalized visually appealing welcome emails or newsletters to new students who join the academy. The system leverages Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Gmail to collect student bio-data, store it in a structured format, and send customized welcome emails formatted like a newsletter. Google Apps Script ties these components together, automating the entire workflow from data collection to email distribution.

Components Involved:

Google Forms:
Purpose: To collect student bio-data, including First Name, Surname, and Email Address.
Design: The form contains three short answer fields: First Name, Surname, and Email Address. Upon submission, the form responses are automatically recorded in a linked Google Sheet.

Google Sheets:
Purpose: To store the student data collected from Google Forms.
Structure: The sheet consists of four columns:
Column A: Timestamp (automatically generated by the form)
Column B: First Name
Column C: Surname
Column D: Email Address
Data Flow: Each form submission adds a new row with the relevant data fields.

Gmail:
Purpose: To send personalized and formatted welcome emails to new students.
Automation: Emails are automatically triggered when a new response is submitted via Google Forms. Each email is customized with the student's first name and is formatted as a professional, visually appealing newsletter.

Google Apps Script:
Purpose: The core automation tool that integrates Google Forms, Sheets, and Gmail. It listens for form submissions, retrieves the appropriate data from the Google Sheet, generates a personalized HTML email, and sends it to the student's email address.
Functionality:
On Form Submission Trigger: A trigger function runs automatically each time a new form is submitted.
Email Generation: The script fetches the student's first name and email address from the form response and uses them to populate a pre-designed HTML email template.
HTML Email Template: The email includes a welcoming message, the academy logo, an introductory paragraph, relevant images, and useful information sections formatted like a newsletter.
Email Sending: The formatted HTML email is sent using GmailApp to the student's provided email address.
Email Design:
Header Section: A dark green (#5ca65c) banner with the academy logo and a welcoming message, greeting the student by their first name (e.g., "Welcome to the Academy, John!").
Body Section: The main content area consists of:
An introductory message expressing excitement about the student joining the academy.
A visual section with an image related to education or the academy, followed by a list of key features the student can expect (e.g., expert-led classes, supportive community, and resource access).
A call-to-action button encouraging the student to explore their dashboard or start learning.
Footer Section: A professional footer with the academy's contact information, support links, and copyright notice.

Project Flow:
Form Submission: A new student submits their information (First Name, Surname, and Email Address) via Google Forms.
Data Population: The form data is automatically populated into the linked Google Sheet.
Automated Script Execution: Google Apps Script is triggered by the form submission event. The script reads the data from the Google Sheet, builds a personalized welcome email, and sends it to the student's email address using Gmail.
Welcome Email: The student receives a visually appealing, personalized email welcoming them to the academy. The email includes an introduction, key details about what they can expect at the academy, and helpful links.

Benefits of the System:
Automation: The system eliminates the need for manual processing, ensuring that each new student receives a welcome email immediately after they submit their information.
Personalization: Each email is customized with the student's first name, making the communication feel more personalized and engaging.
Professional Design: The use of an HTML template allows for a visually appealing design, which enhances the student's first impression of the academy.
Scalability: The system can handle large volumes of student submissions without additional effort, making it suitable for academies with growing enrollments.
