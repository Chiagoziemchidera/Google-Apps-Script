# Automated Calendar Sync and Meeting Scheduler

Overview:
The Automated Calendar Sync and Meeting Scheduler is a Google App Script-based project designed to streamline the process of scheduling meetings. By integrating Google Calendar with Google Forms and the Google Meet API, this system allows users to automatically schedule meetings based on their availability and receive invitations complete with meeting links. This solution eliminates the manual back-and-forth of finding suitable meeting times, ensuring an efficient and seamless scheduling process for both hosts and participants.

Key Features:
Automatic Meeting Scheduling:

The system automatically schedules meetings based on user input (e.g., preferred start time and meeting duration) collected through a Google Form.
It checks the user's availability in Google Calendar using the Free/Busy API to ensure that there are no conflicts before scheduling the meeting.
If a conflict is detected, the user is notified and asked to select a different time.
Google Meet Integration:

Once an available time slot is found, the system automatically creates a meeting in Google Calendar.
The meeting includes a Google Meet video conference link, which is generated through Google Calendar's ConferenceData feature.
This link is shared with all participants via email.

Email Notifications:
The system sends personalized email notifications to meeting attendees, including details about the meeting and the Google Meet link.
Notifications include reminders about the meeting, ensuring participants are aware of upcoming appointments.

Form Response Handling:
A Google Form collects data such as the desired meeting start time, meeting duration, meeting title, and attendees' email addresses.
Responses are stored in a linked Google Sheet for backup and easy management.
The script processes responses, schedules the meeting, and handles all logistics automatically.

Error Handling and Feedback:
The system includes robust error handling to address invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect meeting durations) and scheduling conflicts (e.g., no available time slots).
Users receive feedback via email if a meeting cannot be scheduled, along with suggestions for resolving the issue.

Project Workflow:
User Input: Participants fill out a Google Form to indicate their preferred meeting start time, duration, title, and attendee emails.
Availability Check: The script checks the userâ€™s Google Calendar to ensure there are no conflicts during the requested time.
Meeting Creation: If a suitable time slot is found, the system schedules the meeting in Google Calendar and automatically generates a Google Meet link.
Email Notifications: Once the meeting is scheduled, the system sends email notifications to all participants with the meeting details and the Google Meet link.
Error Handling: If there is an issue with scheduling, such as conflicting availability or invalid inputs, the system notifies the user and provides further instructions.

Use Cases:
Teams and Organizations: This project is ideal for teams that frequently need to schedule meetings across different time zones or with multiple participants, minimizing scheduling conflicts and manual coordination.
Education and Webinars: Educational institutions and organizations conducting webinars can automate the scheduling of virtual sessions with students or participants.
Consultants and Service Providers: Freelancers and consultants can use the system to automatically schedule client meetings, ensuring they are not double-booked and saving time in coordinating meetings.

Technologies Used:
Google Apps Script: To automate the process of interacting with Google Forms, Sheets, Calendar, and Gmail.
Google Calendar API: To check availability, schedule meetings, and generate Google Meet links.
Google Meet: Integrated as the default video conferencing platform for meetings.
Google Forms and Sheets: Used for collecting and storing participant information and meeting preferences.

This project simplifies the meeting scheduling process, improves efficiency, and ensures that all participants are notified with complete and accurate meeting details, including video conference links.
