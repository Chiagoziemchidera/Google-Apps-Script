# Google Form Updater Script
This Google Apps Script is designed to automate the process of dynamically updating a multiple-choice question in a Google Form based on data from a linked Google Sheet. The function retrieves values from a specific column in the Google Sheet and updates the options in the form's multiple-choice question.

Key Components:
Google Form and Sheet IDs:

formId: The unique ID of the Google Form you want to update.
sheetId: The unique ID of the Google Sheet where the new options are stored.
sheetName: The name of the specific sheet (tab) within the Google Sheets file that contains the form responses or options.
Open Google Form and Sheet:

form: Opens the Google Form using its formId.
sheet: Opens the Google Sheet using its sheetId and retrieves the specific sheet by its name (sheetName).

Use Case:
This script is particularly useful when you want to automate the process of synchronizing data between a Google Form and a Google Sheet. For example, if you have a form with a question where the choices frequently change (like a list of available classes, products, or attendees), this script allows you to dynamically update the options without manually editing the form.
